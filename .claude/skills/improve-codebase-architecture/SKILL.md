# Improve Codebase Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities**: refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

This command is _informed_ by the project's domain model and built on a shared design vocabulary:

- Call the Skill tool with "codebase-design" for the architecture vocabulary (**module**, **interface**, **depth**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**, **locality**) and its principles (the deletion test, "the interface is the test surface", "one adapter = hypothetical seam, two = real"). Use these terms exactly in every suggestion, and don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."
- The domain glossary in `docs/reference/extraction-hitl-architecture.md` §6 gives names to good seams. ADRs in `docs/adr/` and the principles in `docs/reference/constitution.md` record decisions this command should not re-litigate.

This is not `architectural-quality-loop`. The loop finds and fixes *violations* of rules prumo already has (drift, layering, legacy, security) and converges through gates. This command proposes *new shape* (deeper modules) and ends in a conversation, not a commit.

## Process

### 1. Explore

**Scope before you scan: YAGNI.** Deepening a module pays off by making future changes to it easier, so put extra weight on the parts of the codebase that have recently changed. Decide *where* to look before you look:

- If the user named a direction (a module, a subsystem, a pain point), take it, and skip the inference below.
- Otherwise, walk back a good stretch of the commit history (`git log --oneline`) to find the codebase's hot spots, the files and areas that keep coming up, and let those paths pull your attention first. If the changes are scattered with no clear hot spot, widen the net.

Read the glossary (§6 above) and any ADRs in the area you're touching first. When `graphify-out/graph.json` exists, `graphify query` and `graphify explain` are a cheap first map of coupling. Recent quality-loop runs under `docs/superpowers/quality-runs/` show friction already found.

Then spawn a sub-agent to walk the codebase. It starts in the main checkout, so give it the absolute path of the tree you mean. Don't follow rigid heuristics; explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow**, with an interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want.

### 2. Present candidates as an HTML report

Write a self-contained HTML file outside the repo: the session scratchpad directory when one exists, otherwise `$TMPDIR`. Name it `architecture-review-<timestamp>.html` so each run gets a fresh file. Open it with `open <path>` and tell the user the absolute path.

The report uses **Tailwind via CDN** for layout and styling, and **Mermaid via CDN** for diagrams where a graph/flow/sequence reliably communicates the structure. Mix Mermaid with hand-crafted CSS/SVG visuals: use Mermaid when relationships are graph-shaped (call graphs, dependencies, sequences), and hand-built divs/SVG when you want something more editorial (mass diagrams, cross-sections, collapse animations). Each candidate gets a **before/after visualisation**. Be visual.

For each candidate, render a card with:

- **Files**: which files/modules are involved
- **Problem**: why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution**: plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits**: explained in terms of locality and leverage, and how tests would improve
- **Before / After diagram**: side-by-side, custom-drawn, illustrating the shallowness and the deepening
- **Recommendation strength**: one of `Strong`, `Worth exploring`, `Speculative`, rendered as a badge

End the report with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate you'd tackle first and why.

**Use glossary vocabulary for the domain, and the `codebase-design` vocabulary for the architecture.** The glossary defines "ReviewerDecision", so talk about "the ReviewerDecision write module", not "the DecisionHandler", and not "the decision service."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR. Mark it clearly in the card (e.g. a warning callout: _"contradicts ADR-0007, but worth reopening because…"_). Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids.

See [HTML-REPORT.md](HTML-REPORT.md) for the full HTML scaffold, diagram patterns, and styling guidance.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. After the file is written, ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Decision loop

Once the user picks a candidate, walk the decision tree with them one question at a time: constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive. Recommend an answer for each question and look the facts up yourself rather than asking the user to.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize; call the Skill tool with "domain-modeling" to keep the domain model current as you go:

- **Naming a deepened module after a domain concept not in the glossary?** Add the term to §6 and its mirror, as `domain-modeling` describes.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update the glossary right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR, framed as: _"Want me to record this as an ADR so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually be needed by a future explorer to avoid re-suggesting the same thing; skip ephemeral reasons ("not worth it right now") and self-evident ones.
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** Call the Skill tool with "codebase-design" and use its design-it-twice parallel sub-agent pattern.

### 4. Hand off

When no open question would still change the design and the user confirms, the chosen deepening is a spec. Hand it to `/ship-spec` or `superpowers:writing-plans`. Don't start refactoring from this session.
