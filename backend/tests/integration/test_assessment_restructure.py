"""
Integration tests for restructured assessment module.

Tests the new assessment structure against real database:
- New tables (assessment_instances, assessment_responses, assessment_evidence)
- Compatibility VIEW (assessments)
- Helper functions (progress, hierarchy)
- Triggers (INSTEAD OF, validation)

These tests verify the migration was successful and everything works end-to-end.
