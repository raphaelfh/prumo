"""fix get_project_members column names and missing fields

Revision ID: 0002
Revises: 0001
Create Date: 2026-03-01

The original function (consolidated in 0001) returned wrong column aliases:
  email, full_name, avatar_url, joined_at
but the frontend and generated Supabase types expect:
  user_email, user_full_name, user_avatar_url, created_at

It also omitted the `id` (project_members.id) and `permissions` columns,
which the frontend needs for update/delete operations.
